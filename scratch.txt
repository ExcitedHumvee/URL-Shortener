Need to build URL shortening API similar to https://tinyurl.com/app
focus on api
service should be able to take a long URL e.g. “https://foobar.com/my_super_long_url_that_no_one_remembers” and return a unique shortened URL that when accessed will redirect the requester to the original long URL

Record statistics for the original URL

use Nest framework, with in memory database
use tests

Tasks:
1. Build an API endpoint that accepts a long URL as its input and ultimately returns a short
URL that when accessed will redirect the user to the original long URL
2. When the short URL is accessed you should store statistics about its use against the
original URL. Think of this as a scoreboard for all of the short URLs, how many times are
they accessed, where are they accessed from, by what unique users
3. Build an API endpoint that will return the URLs and their stored statics. Just imagine we
have a UI that will present a list of URLs alongside its statistics like a scoreboard

steps to install:
    # Create a new Nest project
    $ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
    $ nest new url-shortener-api
    cd into new project
    sudo npm install
    npm run start

to build docker image, make sure docker engine is running by opening docker desktop then:
    docker build -t stanydesa/nest-app .
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 stanydesa/nest-app
    docker ps to check status
